punchline: Crowdsourced FFXIV login queue times, now with Discord queue notification features.
description: |-
  Contributes and utilizes crowdsourced login queue information for the benefit of everyone.
  
  Current features include queue notifications via Discord, so you can know when you make it into the game, as
  well as anonymously collecting and reporting statistics about your login queue times to crowdsource information
  about FFXIV server load. This information will be publicly available in the future; check the Discord for updates!
  
  Future planned features include login wait time estimates, as well as duty queue time statistics, and a website
  showing all of this information.
